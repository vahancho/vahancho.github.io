Well, after more than two decades in software development I suddenly realized
that I can not only read but also share my knowledge and experience with others
who will, probably, benefit from the information they can find here. Thus, I decided
to start a blog - a collection of thoughts, memories and other funny stuff.

So, after some technical preparations, choosing the theme, setting up all the stuff
I'm ready to go. Let's treat this post as the very first one in the blog (I don't
count the [test stuff](/posts/the_first_post) I posted earlier this year).

## Naming

Every blog must have a name or a title. Initially I used my own name as working title.
However, it looked too narcissistic. Besides, I wanted to invent something original
and unique (if it's possible nowadays), that will reflect the nature of the
blog, something to focus rather on coding and software engineering. I asked my family,
used some open AI tools to generate random names and finally came with the name
`The Codeologist`. What does it mean? I've found couple of definitions on the
[Urban dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=codeologist), e.g.:

> *A person skilled in writing software code*

and

> *A person who takes pride in writing code*

Both seem to fit very well and I've immediately renamed the blog.

## The Logo

It's nice if blog has a logo - another challenge, especially if you are not experienced
designer. I've solved this much quicker by using free stuff on
[Canva](https://www.canva.com/). And here what I've made:

![The Logo](/assets/img/logo.png){: w="200" .shadow}
_The logo_

The light bulb indicates the knowledge spread. The rest is clear, I believe.

## Discussions

Initially each blog post has a section at the bottom allowing to leave a comment if any.
I'm quite excited to get feedback from readers, taking into account that this
is my first experience in blogging.
