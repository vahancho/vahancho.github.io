My first visit to Hamburg took place back in Summer 2010, namely on 13th of June, 2010.
I memorized the exact date because it was the beginning of completely new and exciting
chapter of my life.

It was a warm and sunny Summer day when I first arrive in Hamburg airport.
I didn't know at that time that such a nice weather is rear in Hamburg, at least,
if compare with Yerevan, where it's sunny most of the time, even in winter.
I went out the plane and immediately found myself in the crowdy airport building.
Following the *"Ausgang - Exit"* signs I went down the stairs past the large poster
with "Welcome to Hamburg" greetings written in dozens of languages (didn't find
Armenian letters, unfortunately). I didn't need to wait for my luggage, because
my trip must be short, and I took only a backpack. Of course, my photo camera was
also with me. I catch a taxi and headed up directly to the hotel.

While driving I didn't pay too much attention on surrounding and was focused on
the main purpose of my visit to Hamburg - the job interview. Three days long
trip included arrival on day one, passing (or failing) the job interview on the
day two and finally return flight on the third day - not too much time for relaxing.

Looking from the cab's window I thought about the past few months preceding my
visit to Hamburg. The phone interview, exchange of many emails, negotiation and
planning for an onsite interview, complex visa application procedure in German
embassy etc. All these were in the past now, and I should, perhaps, feel a deep relief,
but couldn't - so much time and energy invested, and it would be pity to fail on
the last stage. Yeah, I admit, was really nervous.

This time I decided to avoid my previous mistakes and reserve significant time
for taking enough rest and sleep, especially after long journey and nightly flight.
Studying in university, bazillion tests, exams and interviews have taught me a
simple empiric rule: *fresh brain is almost a half of the success*. The only thing
I had to do was finding the company's office in order to save time the next
morning. Fortunately the hotel was located in a couple of hundred meters from the
office, and I've easily found it - I knew where to go next morning.

The hotel and the office settled on the territory of the former gas factory. The
surrounding had (and still has) a very authentic design - all buildings built of
red bricks were preserved from the factory, but internally were transformed into
modern offices occupied by multiple small and large companies.

I was walking around, exploring the buildings and went further along a street without
knowing where I go. I didn't care, actually, as everything was new and interesting.
I recall very well small open street cafes in the neighborhood, dozens of men sitting at the
tables outside with bottles of cold bear and watching a football game (*[FIFA World
Cap 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup) in South Africa*)
on large TV screens. They were really loud and expressive
about the game. Some looked suspiciously at me holding a large EOS camera[^fn1]:)

That day streets were unusually quiet and calm[^fn2]
with only a few pedestrians, however I spotted some interesting ones too. All these
immediately built up a special feeling of the city, which preserved until now.

The company that invited me to the job interview was rather small, but prominent
one (unfortunately the company doesn't exist anymore, and this is the second
company I worked in that disappeared). They produced a famous GUI test automation
tool, which was widely used, especially for `Qt` based applications.

Combination of `C++` programming language, `Qt` framework, test automation and being
small and startup like made the company very attractive to me - it corresponded
to my skillset and was exactly what I was looking for.

When next morning I first rang the doorbell and stepped into the office I saw a
relatively tiny but cozy space, split into even smaller rooms occupied by two
computer desks each. Although, at that time the company was already seven years
old, it still preserved the startup mood with a minimum of bureaucracy and
was led by two co-founders sharing responsibilities of CEO, CTO etc.[^fn3]
I never saw such a small company before, but liked the working spirit within.
Inhabitants welcomed me, introduced themselves and enthusiastically told about
their work and experience. I met a few engineers with the wide range of technical
skills. Surprisingly, there were no managers, leads and other formal hierarchies -
only a self organized community of engineers.

The interview itself went well. I introduced myself, told about my past, the present
and the career path. My previous experience as a test engineer seemed to be beneficial
for the company whose main product was a test automation tool. We've found many aspects
in common in what I did before and what the company currently does and going to do.
It built up an impression that I'm a good fit to the company. Finally, I've solved
an algorithmic coding task on the whiteboard with the detailed explanation of the solution.
After all the questions were asked, the interviewers offered me to leave and wait
while they are discussing their impressions. Although I was trying to stay calm,
I was very excited, but ready  for any decision. In 15-20 minutes both co-founders
came and told me that they liked how it went and want to offer me a job in the company.
That was a great news, and I was trying to suppress my excitement and happiness.
It didn't take to much time to decide to accept the offer to join the team.

When I was going to leave the office one of the co-founders offered me to meet in
the evening for a short city tour in Hamburg. I was surprised by such an attention
and gladly agreed, because, as mentioned earlier, I hadn't had a chance to walk to
the downtown or somewhere else except the hotel's surroundings on the day of arrival,
and it would be a great opportunity to see the city. I also thought that we could
get to know better each other in a less formal atmosphere.
In the same evening we met in the hotel's lobby and drove to my first city tour in
Hamburg. Along the Elbe river to the harbor full of huge containerships, then to
the downtown, where I saw the beautify city hall, tall churches, Inner Alster Lake
with its yachts and boots, crowded narrow streets with expensive shops. I was
impressed how all these were harmonized within a single city and I started to feel it.

The idea to offer a city tour in addition to the job interview was a great and
wise move from the company side, because I immediately feel belonging and got being
accepted by the company and the team not only formally, but also emotionally. Such
a personal treatment of new hires can boost the motivation and engagement.
Unfortunately I never saw such moves from other companies either before or after.

I had to leave the hotel next morning. The cab has arrived perfectly on time, and
the driver was a friendly guy. As he spoke English we chatted while headed up to
the airport. He was curious about what I'm doing in Hamburg. When he knew I'm a
software developer, just got a job offer and going to move to Hamburg to work here
he smiled and told: *"That's great! We need highly-qualified guys in Germany"*.
Perhaps, it sounds a bit naive, but this phrase has built up in me an inner
confidence that I'm on the right way and everything will be fine.

When the airplane finally took off, I looked from the window on Hamburg below.
At that moment I just realized how beautiful it is from above: the harbor, the
Elbe river, Alster, greens and parks. This view has built up my feeling of Hamburg
as a city which stays with me until now.

When I was back to home my wife asked me: *"What do you think about Hamburg?"*, I
immediately formulated my impression in one sentence:

>There are cities that have parks inside, but Hamburg is a park with a city inside...

P. S. At that time we didn't know that it will take about six months to finally
move to Hamburg. But it is another story.

[^fn1]: At that time built-in cell phone cameras weren't that powerful and good as nowadays in smartphones.
[^fn2]: I realized it later that it was Sunday, and nobody (well, almost) works on Sundays in Germany. Most of the stores, supermarkets are closed.
[^fn3]: Actually the company was never a classical startup founded by an entrepreneur. They always had a product to ship and no investors' money, AFAIK.
