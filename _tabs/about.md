_Vahan Aghajanyan_

I'm Vahan Aghajanyan the author of this blog. I develop software since 1999 and have
a rich experience in doing it as well as in testing and test automation. Over the
years of engineering career, I have been influential in the industries such as
Design for Manufacturing (DFM), Semiconductor Engineering, testing and
test automation tools, maritime applications (navigation software and tools),
financial applications and ERP systems.

I was born and grew up in Armenia where I've graduated in 1997 and made my first career steps.
Since 2011 I enjoy my living and working in Hamburg - the best city in Germany if
not more.
